## DLP-KDD2022 Introduction

In the increasingly digitized world, applications in a wide varity of domains are shifting to harness the ability to process, understand, and exploit data collected from different sources. Deep learning-based methods, in particularly, have recently empowered many applications to leveraging their data. This incluses examples from customer-centric applications, such as personalized recommendations, online advertising, search engines and interest/intention modeling from customersâ€™ behavior. In these applications, leveraging deep learning tools can significantly enhance the user's experience while increasing revenues. Data generated in customer-centric applications and other critical real-world domains such as health and medicine, biology, business, industrial engineering, _etc_ are often high-dimensional, sparse and imbalanced. These adverse data properties challenge the application of deep learning in real-world applications due to the fact that they can cause poor model performance, failed projects, and potentially serious social implications.

The complexities explored here are different from many traditional deep learning applications, such as image classification and speech recorgnition, which have rich, dense datasets for model development and testing. Typical prediction tasks related to click-through rates, for example, involve billions of sparse features. Thus, the question of how to mine, model and perform inference on such data is a challenging and interesting problem. The characteristics  of high-dimensional, sparse and imbalanced data pose unique challenges to the adoption of deep learning, and requires the community to re-assess the traditional methodologies and explore novel domain-specific approaches to learn and evaluate robust and trustworthy model. This workshop will provide a venue for researchers and practicioners to discuss challenges, opportunities, and new ideas related to the application of deep learning on high-dimensional, sparse, and imbalanced data. 

These challenges have been widely studied by the traditional machine learning and data mining community, and new techniques have been developed for deep learning. These include methods such as transfer learning, few-shot learning, meta-learning, active learning, data resampling, data generation and augmentation, one-class learning, domain decompositions, etc.. Through the course of this workshop, we will drill into the latest challenges and methodologies whilst reflecting on what the traditional machine learning and data mining researchers can contribute to the advancement of state-of-the-art in deep learning from high-dimensional, sparse, and imbalanced data with adverse properties. The workshop will bring together a diverse cross-section of speakers and a wide community of data mining and deep learning researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government.
